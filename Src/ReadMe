Pancake Flip problem algorithm takes an unsorted stack of 'N' and returns a sorted stack from least to greatest
each Pancake Flip problem can only sort using one method- reversing a stack at an index 'I'
Each language in this repository demonstrates a version of the pancake flip algorithm 
//PANCAKE SORT ALG
    //base case: one element left
    
    //find biggest in stack
    //if biggest is not in place: 
    //flip biggest to the top
    //flip whole stack
    
    //sort top
